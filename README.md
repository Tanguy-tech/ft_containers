📒 Subject : [Find ft_container's subject HERE](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/46641/fr.subject.pdf)

Containers in C++ all have a specific use.
To make sure you understand them, you will implement them!
In this project you will implement some C++ containers from the
library (Standard Template Library).
You have to use the structure of the original containers as a basis. If a part of the canonical form of Coplien is not present, don't do it.
Remember, You must conform to the C++98 standard. Therefore, any newer newer functionality should NOT be done, but any C++98 functionality (even obsolete) is functionality (even obsolete) is expected.

▶️ Usage:
- In your terminal window, run `make`
- Still in your terminal, run executable `./ft_containers`. Output will show you original STL result in PINK and ft results in YELLOW. ENJOY ;)
